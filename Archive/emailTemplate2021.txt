I hope you all truly had a wonderful 2021, I am stoked that Christmas will be a little more normal this year. This year there have been some new additions to the family, of course I corrected the mistake with Harriet, then I added our snuggly Owen. As for the adults I made a half hearted attempt to reach those that may want to include a plus one. Just a reminder that at any time you may contact me and I will make the necessary changes. With that said please give a warm welcome to Gideon (Domi), Micheal (Cecilia) and Hector (Lauren).

As acting Supreme Master Overlord of Christmas we are allowing you {giftMaker} a choice, you may either make a donation of $10 to a charity or your choice on behalf of the recipient or you may stick with the standard $5 gift.
[[newline]]
In either case you must be sure that your person will have “something” to open by Christmas day.

For those of you that are lucky enough to buy a present for anyone in the Hoorneart family; they will be in Wisconsin Dec. 25th to Dec 31st. Hopefully we will get to see many of you this year.

For those of you that are lucky enough to have Zoe, Clare, or Marco they will also be in Wisco from the 25th to the 28th, so have your present in Wisco.
Love,
