Merry Christmas {giftMaker},
[[newline]]
By now you should all know the drill...
[[newline]]
1. Send email/text to Supreme Master Overlord of Christmas (bagehred@sbcglobal.net)/(414-530-3325) that you have gotten your pick.
[[newline]]
2. Notify family members you got your name for Christmas. Relay that, if they do not have a name, they could check their SPAM folder, or get in touch with Uncle Bob. (bagehred@sbcglobal.net)/(414-530-3325)
[[newline]]
3. Enjoy maker spacing your gift for your beloved family member.
[[newline]]
This could be a duplicate email, if you have responded already I apologize and disregard, otherwise please read on.
[[newline]]
So let me float an idea that was presented to me by Rachel,
[[newline]]
The idea is rather than one person opening their gift in front of the rest of the family. We allow multiple people to open their gifts simultaneously.
[[newline]]
So for example we would have group A give there gift to group B. So picture 15-20 people all getting their gifts at once. Yes it sounds chaotic at first,
[[newline]]
but think of the time savings, also it could be more personal and for the introverts makes it less of a show and more meaningful. Then Group B would give there gifts
[[newline]]
all simultaneously. As Rachel said, people could find out what other people got in the following conversations.
[[newline]]
So when you respond, please feel free to vote on Proposition #3 Rachels mass gift give idea. Yeah / Nay
[[newline]]
Now that we have gotten the business taken care of, I hope you enjoyed 2024. We got to witness a number of wedding celebrations, Natalie, Maria and Calvin all hosted fabulous parties.
[[newline]]
Life around the Whitefish Bay Gehred's has settled down, with both Max and C out of the house and the remodel all finished we will be ready to host you all for the Shout-A-long.
[[newline]]
Love,
[[newline]]
Supreme Master Overlord of Christmas
